# Why do we need to moniter



# What are the 4 golden rules of monitering?

Latency: The time it takes for a request to be serviced, which can indicate the responsiveness and performance of a system.

Traffic: The amount of demand being placed on a system, measured in requests per second, and can help in scaling the system up or down depending on the volume of requests.

Errors: The rate of requests that are failing, either explicitly (such as HTTP 500 errors) or implicitly (such as returning the wrong content), and can help in identifying and resolving issues in the system.

Saturation: How full a system is in terms of resource utilization, and can help in identifying when a system is approaching its capacity limits.

Using these four rules in monitoring can help in identifying and diagnosing issues in a distributed system, as well as optimizing and scaling the system for better performance and reliability.
